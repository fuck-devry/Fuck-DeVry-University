# FUCK DEVRY UNIVERSITY
## Borrowers Defense Application Resources
### Intro
Hello, I created this page to make it easier for other victims of DeVry University's malicious marketing strategy to find resources to file for Borrowers Defense. The biggest thing that stopped me from filing my application besides Devos was not having the original marketing material. Well I have spent a large amount of time using archive.org, searching email and reddit for material to build the best application possible. If you have any additional documents/comments/tips to add feel free to open a Merge Request or message me.

I am not a layer, this is not legal advice. All documents scrapped from public internet locations such as archive.org.

### Personal Experience
The website gave me a generic error twice at different times so I did a PDF application and included more material than I was allowed to upload. I used some verbiage from the lawsuits summary to build my case.
